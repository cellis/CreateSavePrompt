## Sublime Create Save Prompt

## Why?

I was tired of trying to create new files with `CMD+N` and not being able to save them to arbitrary locations without using mac's awful save file experience. This plugin fixes that.

## Installation

Working on getting this accepted into the package manager

## Other notes.

May/probably won't work on windows. Send me a pull req. if you want it to.
